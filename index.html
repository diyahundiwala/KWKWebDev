    <p class="usAbout"> ✨✨<br><br>Our mission is to iniSHEate change within the tech field and inspire young women and nonbinary people to pursue careers in technology. This website is our Kode With Klossy (KWK) final project. After a KWK Culture in Tech session, we were all feeling pretty inspired, motivated, and shocked by the lack of diversity within the field of technology. Plenty of young women and non-binary people are interested in the tech field. However, based on our personal experience, we know that the number of resources available can be scarce or often overwhelming. Through iniSHEate, we want to streamline valuable and reliable resources for young women and nonbinary people, and provide them with a platform to get educated and inspired!
    <br><br>😊😊<br><br>
    Our website is directed towards young women and non-binary people. 74% of girls express a desire to pursue a STEM-related career, but most either don’t have access to appropriate resources, or are overwhelmed by the number of resources at their disposal.
    With our site, we would like to bridge this disparity and encourage them to take an interest in the tech field.
    <br><br>💖💖<br><br>
    This website is a library of resources and inspiration for young girls and non-binary people to empower them to be trailblazers in the tech field. All of you are so amazing and can do anything you put your mind and heart to! <3 
    <br><br>🥰🥰<br><br>
